# Note-Taker-App

App that will track notes

## Description

This application was made so you could make a note and save it to the page and delete the note. This helps organize people's daily lives by keeping track of important items they place inside the notes. When they finish the item in the note, the can delete the note so it is no longer on their task list. During building this application I learned how to make GET, POST, and DELETE routes. Retrieve data from the backend instead of local storage and append it to the page as well as add on to the object array in the back end.
